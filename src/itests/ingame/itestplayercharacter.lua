-- at frame 2: bpos (19.90625, 56 - 3.25), velocity (-0.0703125, -3.25), air_spin (apply air accel, do not apply gravity on first frame of jump since we were grounded)

-- unfortunately vx is affected by air drag which is hard to sum
-- but we really care about y and vy in this test, moving in x is only to reproduce the "jump through ceiling" when moving diagonally" bug
-- so we cheat and copy-paste retroactively the itest result passed values into expectations there
-- which gives expected velocity = 0.604400634765625 - -0x000.9aba
-- at frame 2+n: bpos (19.90625-0.0703125*n-0.046875*n*(n+1)/2, 56 - 3.25 - 3.25*n + 0.109375*n*(n+1)/2), velocity (-0.0703125-0.046875*n REDUCED BY DRAG, -3.25+0.109375*n), air_spin

-- a = 0.0546875
-- b = -3.1953125
-- c = 40
-- DELTA = b*b - 4ac = 1.46002197265625 (should be small since we aim for position close to ceiling which is also close to apogee so both solutions are close to it)
-- just to check:
-- -b/2a = 29.21428571428571428571 (apogee, at 30 frames as we know)
-- We are interested in the first time we reach the ceiling of course, so:
-- s1 = (-b - sqrt(DELTA)) / (2*a) = 18.16684626582767176288
-- so let's explore around 18

-- at frame 17: bpos (4, 17.125), velocity (-0.7734375, -1.609375), air_spin -> before apogee

-- added to fix #129 BUG MOTION curve_run_up_fall_in_wall
-- with bug, character is preserving his center but when falling without spinning,
--  his shape is a rectangle not a square, so the instant rotation of 90 degrees
--  will place his feet inside the wall just above the steep slope (responsible
--  for the sudden quadrant change)
-- with the fix, his position should be readjusted so his feet really just touch the wall
--  increasing max_ground_escape_height to 6 can hotfix the thing, but it would still take
--  2 frames to move down a full pixel and trigger the escape during ground motion
-- that's why we prefer solving the issue on frame 9 (when landing is done) and not frame 11
-- note that in the tilemap, we add the column of # for a realistic case,
--  but even without them the issue appears, which makes us think the issue is the same as
--  #128 BUG MOTION edgy_rising_curve_sonic_stuck and possibly
--  #131 BUG MOTION fall_on_curve_to_death
