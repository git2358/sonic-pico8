-- human tests: let human check rendering (until I find a way to automate this)
-- they have no final assertion, and will always succeed
-- although it's about rendering, we don't strip them from busted headless itests so we can debug the trace without having to run pico8

-- bugfix history:
-- = fixed character pivot computed from drawn sprite topleft (with some gap above character's head)
--   and not actual sprite topleft in the spritesheet
