  -- we tried to adjust this value to PICO-8 scale with a law of three: 96Ã—128/224 ~= 55
  --  so the original game offset would scale to 55 - 64 = -9
  -- however, even with scaling PICO-8 shows fewer tiles vertically so we tend to miss interesting
  --  things above the character, so we moved it closer to 0
  -- set to 0 if you want to recenter window vertically
  window_center_offset_y = -4,

  -- half width of the camera window (px)
  -- According to SPG, window left and right are dissymmetrical,
  --  which is not convenient is levels where moving left is just as important
  --  as moving right. As suggested, we center the window horizontally but preserve
  --  the half-width: ((160 - 144) / 2) / 2 (PICO-8 scaling)
  -- That's why there is no window_center_offset_x
  window_half_width = 4,

  -- half height of the camera window (px)
  -- only used during air motion
  -- ((128 - 64) / 2) / 2 (PICO-8 scaling)

  -- catchup speed on Y when grounded with ground speed < fast_catchup_min_ground_speed

  -- Forward offset system

  -- Base: When character is looking forward a horizontal direction for a certain time
  --  or on landing, the camera moves slightly forward (original feature to counter
  --  the fact that PICO-8 screen has a much shorter width, being a square)

  -- base forward offset following character orientation (px)
  forward_distance = 8,

  -- time before grounded orientation effectively changes base forward offset direction (frames)
  grounded_orientation_confirmation_duration = 30,

  -- Extension: When character is moving fast on X, the camera moves even farther forward
  --  so the player can see what's incoming (Sonic CD only, but common in modern speed platformers)
  -- If orientation is opposed to velocity X (backward running / jumping),
  --  both offsets oppose each other
  -- As suggested by the SPG, we apply this to airborne motion instead of only ground speed in Sonic CD
  -- In counterpart, because we don't apply this to ground speed anymore,
  --  running on a slope will be considered slower in X and will require an even higher ground speed
  --  to activate the forward extension.
  -- If it's an issue, just reduce forward_ext_min_speed_x or switch to a gradual system
  --  where the forward extension distance gradually increases toward its max when speed X increases.

  -- min speed on X to activate forward extension (px/frame)
  -- note that at exactly this speed, ratio is still 0 so no offset is applied
  forward_ext_min_speed_x = 2.5,

  -- speed on X at which forward extension reaches its maximum distance (px/frame)
  -- at this speed, ratio is 1 and (+/-) forward_ext_max_distance is applied
  max_forward_ext_speed_x = 3,

  -- forward extension maximum distance (px)
  -- at speeds between forward_ext_min_speed_x and max_forward_ext_speed_x, a ratio is applied
  forward_ext_max_distance = 32,

  -- catchup speed on X to reach maximum forward extension (px/frame)
  forward_ext_catchup_speed_x = 0.5,
