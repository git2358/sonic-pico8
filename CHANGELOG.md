and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.2] - 2020-09-27
### Added
- Tilemap: switch to extended map system. Angel Island is now split is 3x2 regions of 128x32 tiles, defined in separate PICO-8 cartrdiges and reloaded into memory at runtime when approaching those regions. When close to 2-4 regions, an transition region is created from 2-4 patches of existing map data. Item collision and render also support this new system.
- Tilemap: redrew extended map with 6 regions with complete skinning, except for palm trees
- Loop: external loop triggers allow to setup correct collision layer *before* entering loop
- Animation: added 4 sprites to spin cycle
- Camera: camera window and smooth motion depending on character grounded/airborne state

### Changed
- Animation: better walk cycle with 6 sprites
- Tilemap: draw loop entrance on foreground by drawing on-screen sprites manually
- Tilemap: removed loop flags, now loop triggers are defined in stage data
- Tile: fixed spring animation when landing on right part
- Tile: fixed loop collision data
- Export: fixed export icon

## [4.1] - 2020-09-21
### Added
- Spring tile and behavior
- Emerald tile and behavior
- Detail tiles: falling leaves, hiding leaves
- Animation: character run cycle when moving on ground at high speed
- Jump SFX (takes over less important music channel)
- Credits screen

### Changed
- Split project in two cartridges: titlemenu and ingame (to drop compressed size under 100% and allow export again)
- Reorganized spritesheet and collision data
- Skinned level completely, improved shapes, added ceiling, springs and emeralds
- Render foreground after midground (grass and leaves)

## [4.0] - 2020-09-10
### Added
- Character falls off wall or ceiling when running too slow
- Character sprite rotates gradually to be upward when airborne
- Character cannot intentionally move after losing ground (horizontal control lock)
- Stripped version of Angel Island Act 1 (replaces proto zone), skinning WIP
- Camera stops at stage boundaries
- Character cannot go past the left edge of the stage
- Ground tile detection system applied to loop: loop collision layer system allows character to run through it. Does not support going through loop twice in the same direction
- Background: sky, sea with light reflections, trees and leaves with parallax

### Changed
- Updated pico-boots to v1.0
- Snap character sprite angle to closest 45-degree step (closer to Sonic 1\~3 than Sonic Mania)
- Moved goal to stage right boundary
- Character spawns on ground on stage start
- Fixed air spin sprite angle being affected by previous rotation on ground
- Fixed pixel jitter when running on ceiling
- Fixed character landing inside slope
- Fixed character landing 1px above the ground
- Fixed collision mask on loop tiles

## [3.2] - 2020-08-25
### Added
- Loop quadrant system (walk at any angle, jump orthogonally)

## [3.1] - 2020-08-11
### Added
- Angel Island tiles
- Serialization module (represent data as string)

### Changed
- Original feature: Reduced Deceleration on Descending Slope
- Original feature: No Friction on Steep Descending Slope
- Original feature: Progressive Ascending Slope Factor
- Set minimum playback speed for Running animation
- Reduced tokens heavily by extracting code in modules and using data serialization

## [3.0] - 2020-07-11
### Added
- Game: split airborne state into falling and air_spin to only play Spin animation on jump
- Game: when going airborne/grounded, adapt height and center position so Sonic hits the ceiling when we expect by looking at the sprite
- Test: convert itests to new DSL system

### Changed
- Project: extracted engine as submodule pico-boots, adapted build pipeline
- Game: set pink as transparent color for Sonic sprites to match newâ€¦
- Game: preserve last animation (including playback speed) when falling
- Game: only allow ceiling detection during descending motion if abs(vel.x) > abs(vel.y)
- Test: improved itests

## [2.3-sprite-anim] - 2019-05-16
### Added
- Engine: sprite animation system
- Game: press X to toggle debug motion
- Game: added air motion block with wall, ceiling and landing
- Game: character running animation
- Game: character can run on slopes
- Test: added itest for running up a slope
- Test: convert itests to new DSL system

### Changed
- Project: split engine and game folders properly
- Engine: misc logging fixes
- Game: clamp ground speed on acceleration
- Game: fixed sticky jump input during jump
- Game: fixed air motion pixel flooring system

## [2.2] - 2018-10-31
### Added
- Game: added Air Spin sprite used when airborne
- Test: completed 100% coverage on player character

### Changed
- Game: fixed ground speed accumulating during wall block
- Game: character is blocked by ceiling and diagonal tiles
- Game: cleaner wall block by cutting subpixels

## [2.1] - 2018-10-27
### Added
- Game: character snaps to lower ground when walking
- Game: character falls when walking off a cliff
- Game: character can jump with air control (X axis motion)
- Game: apply artificial gravity after jump interrupt, allow hop on 1-frame jumps

## [2.0-flat-ground] - 2018-09-09
### Added
- Game: character can walk on flat ground
- Test: added support for #solo for headless itests

## [2.0-land] - 2018-09-08
### Added
- Game: blue sky background
- Game: added gravity, character can fall and land on ground
- Test: integration (simulation) test system aka "itests"

### Changed
- Engine: improved logging, classes, math

## [1.0] - 2018-07-06
### Added
- Engine: application: constants, flow with gamestates
- Engine: core modules: class, coroutine, helper, math
- Engine: debug tools: codetuner, logging, profiler using WTK
- Engine: input: mouse input and button IDs
- Engine: render: color constants and sprite render
- Engine: UI: render mouse and overlay system
- Engine: build: basic build pipeline with data.p8 and post-build replace strings script
- Game: gamestates title menu, in-game, credits (empty)
- Game: menu: simple titlemenu to start the debug stage
- Game: in-game: stage shows title on start, plays BGM, has goal
- Game: in-game: debug character flies X/Y on directional input, go back to title menu on reach goal
- Test: all busted unit tests in separator folder tests
